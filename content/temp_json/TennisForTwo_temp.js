			'the first video games that featured an graphical display. ',
			'Higginbotham created the game in response to the upcoming ',
			'"visitor day" at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, ',
			'New York. According to Higinbotham, the visitor day was ',
			'generally rather uneventful and boring, and Tennis for Two ',
			'was created in response to this fact to make the event more ',
			'exciting. One of the computers the army used was able to ',
			'calculate the trajectory of ballistic missiles, and he used ',
			'this technology to develop the game. Unsurprisingly, the game ',
			'was a huge hit among the attendees and reports suggest that ',
			'huge lines formed to play the simple, yet at the time ',
			'innovative game. Even though Higginbotham realized that he ',
			'had developed something very unique, he never patented the ',
			'idea due to the fact that the United States government ',
			'would have gained ownership of it("But if I had realized ',
			'just how significant it was, I would have taken out a patent ',
			'and the U.S. government would own it!" - Higginbotham). ',
			'For two years the game was in commission until it was ',
			'unfortunately dismanteled.'
